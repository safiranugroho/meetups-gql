Mingle, learn, and hang out with those wanting to keep up with the latest in technology. It’s our shout, so please join us for a fun and casual session over drinks and nibbles with networking to follow.</p> <p>THE LAYMAN'S GUIDE TO SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE<br/>You might expect that that this forty five minutes session will completely summarise everything you need to know about software architecture. Unfortunately, it most probably will not. Instead, this session is the next best thing: A guide for the uninitiated; explained for the layman. Just enough to get you started.</p> <p>This is my humble take on what \"just enough\" knowledge is:<br/>- Is there an easy way to understand what software architecture is?<br/>- How do you explain the role of an architect?<br/>- How does design fit into architecture?<br/>- Who makes technical decisions?<br/>- When should decisions be made?<br/>- What should be the primary focus for decision making?</p> <p>If you are a software professional such as a Developer, BA, QA, PM or Architect who wants to know more about the general principles of software architecture, then sign up and join us in the discussion!</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Liauw Fendy, Lead Consultant, ThoughtWorks</p> <p>Fendy is a Lead Developer with ThoughtWorks. He has worked in ThoughtWorks for 9 years across North America, Brazil, Thailand, China and Australia. His experience spans software delivery, I.T. assessments, enablement, discovery, inception, and coaching / training engagements.

Postgraphile generates customisable CRUD actions for you, allowing you to focus on implementing your business logic. Postgraphile allows you to fully leverage the power of Postgres’ through your GraphQL API - and if you can’t do something in SQL, it easily is extendable through JavaScript.</p> <p>7:15pm – Break for food, drinks and chat.</p> <p>8:00pm – Jayden Seric: Declarative image preloading<br/>Often GraphQL schemas contain fields that resolve URLs for assets such as profile pictures. Learn how to setup a GraphQL server so clients can specify via field args which URLs the browser should automatically prefetch or preload, using vanilla HTTP Link headers. Load images the moment the GraphQL response is received, instead of when elements finally mount. Preload slideshow images without hacky JS! Learn how next-graphql-react forwards such headers to the client after SSR, and other tips and tricks.</p> <p>8:45pm – Event finish.<br/>---</p> <p>If you’re interested in presenting at one of the meetups, please message either David Burles or Jayden Seric here on meetup.com.</p> ",

The value proposition of serverless is clear: it takes away the complexities of creating and managing highly available and scalable applications while allowing you to focus on business value and significantly reduce operating costs.Different cloud providers offer serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms that allow you to build and deploy applications at a very high speed. However, serverless does not fit every single scenario. In this talk, we will see how easy is create and deploy serverless APIs, but also go deeper and discuss use cases, best practices, instance lifecycle, constraints and drawbacks covering the good, the bad, and the ugly of serverless.</p> <p>Speaker: Paco De la Cruz, Cloud Architect &amp; Developer, Deloitte Platform Engineering<br/>Paco is a Senior Cloud Solutions Architect and Developer and Azure MVP with 18+ years of professional experience architecting and implementing integration solutions and distributed applications; more recently focused on Azure and cloud applications.
