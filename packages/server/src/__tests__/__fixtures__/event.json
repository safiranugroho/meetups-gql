  "description": "<p>****** EVENT Changed to ONLINE via Zoom *****<br/>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, this event is now changed to an online event via Zoom <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/</a></p> <p>The Zoom link will be sent to those who RSVP. Check your meetup organiser announcements and/or your email if you provided that when RSVPing.</p> <p>Stay strong and stay well.<br/>**********************************<br/>Yes, for the first time we will be trialling online pitches. Letâ€™s try this. Letâ€™s have some fun ... we must, at this difficult time for everyone.</p> <p>Got something to pitch?<br/>Please signup on our website and register your pitch here <a href=\"https://siliconbeachgroup.org/pitch-request/\" class=\"linkified\">https://siliconbeachgroup.org/pitch-request/</a></p> <p>We will keep the online pitches to 90 seconds. So practice. Your mic will be muted after 90 seconds!</p> <p>Did you know that anyone can do a 90 second pitch at a Silicon Beach Pitch Night? Yes, itâ€™s an open mic night for startups and small businesses who support startups. You can even pitch an idea to have it validated. Or pitch for a co-founder, techie or anyone else.</p> <p>While we give priority to startups (Silicon Beach is a startup community) we do appreciate the part Small Businesses play in the startup eco-system. Small businesses who provide services to startups are welcome to pitch.</p> <p>No pitch decks please - just you talking.</p> <p>If your startup idea is good, we may ask you to pitch at a next level pitch night to take you through the startup journey towards capital raising via connections to angel investors, VCs, mentors, co-founders, customers etc. A SiliconIcubator is in the making. Come with us on the journey:)</p> <p>It all starts with a 90 second pitch</p> <p>~~~~~~~</p> <p>We are on a mission to propel Australia to #2 ranked startup nation in the world by 2025.
